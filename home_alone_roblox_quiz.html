    const homeAlone = `Last month, I had an unforgettable experience. My parents went to my grandmother's house for the weekend, and I had to stay home alone because I had extra classes at school. At first, I was very excited because I felt free to do anything I wanted.\n\nOn the first night, I cooked instant noodles for dinner and watched my favorite movie. Everything felt fun until I heard strange noises from the kitchen. My heart beat so fast! I grabbed a broomstick and carefully walked to the kitchen. Luckily, it was only the cat knocking down a glass. I laughed at myself for being so scared.\n\nThe next morning, I cleaned the house, washed the dishes, and even did my homework earlier than usual. In the evening, I talked to my parents on the phone and told them about my ‚Äúadventure.‚Äù\n\nStaying home alone taught me something important: being independent is not easy, but it can make me stronger and more responsible.`;

    const roblox = `Last week, I had a funny and unforgettable experience when I played Roblox with my friends. We joined a roleplay game where everyone had to talk and act like real characters. At first, I just typed normal sentences, but then one of my friends started joking around and the chat turned into a very random conversation.\n\nWe laughed so hard because someone pretended to be a teacher, while another acted as a lost student who couldn't find the classroom. I joined the joke by becoming the ‚Äújanitor‚Äù who gave directions in a dramatic way. The whole chat was full of laughter and silly emojis.\n\nAt the end, we realized that even though it was just a game, the conversation made us feel closer as friends. It was a simple but fun experience, and I learned that online games can also create real moments of joy and connection.`;
